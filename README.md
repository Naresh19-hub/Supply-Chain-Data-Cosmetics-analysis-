# Supply-Chain-Data(Cosmetics analysis)
## Project Objective
I’ve been working on an extensive Excel-based project analyzing supply chain performance across product categories, shipping partners, locations, and suppliers within an e-commerce framework.

## Dataset used

## Process
- In this project, I analyzed end-to-end e-commerce supply chain data to uncover insights on product performance, shipping efficiency, and supplier reliability. I used Excel tools like slicers, pivot tables, and charts to visualize key metrics such as lead times, defect rates, and delivery costs. The analysis helped identify improvement areas in logistics, inventory planning, and customer demand targeting.
